# NodejsTasks
Small tasks related to Node.js
# Develop a RESTful API to manage user information:
1. Use Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) user records.
2. Store user information such as name, email, and password securely in the database.
3. Implement proper input validation for all API requests to ensure data integrity.
# Implement authentication and authorization:
1. Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure the API endpoints.
2. Create an endpoint for users to sign up and login, and return a JWT upon successful authentication.
3. Add middleware to verify the JWT on all protected endpoints.
4. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.
# Develop an endpoint to upload and store images:
1. Create an endpoint to receive image files and store them in a cloud storage service such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
2. Return a URL for the image that can be used to retrieve the image at a later time.
3. Implement proper error handling for image upload failures.
# Get weather information by location:
1. Create an endpoint that accepts a user’s latitude and longitude and returns the current weather information for that location using a weather API such as OpenWeatherMap.
2. Parse the JSON response from the weather API and return relevant information such as temperature, wind speed, and condition.
3. Implement proper error handling for API failures.
# Implement pagination:
1. Add a pagination endpoint for the user data to return a specific number of records per page.
2. Allow users to specify the page number and number of records per page in the API request.
3. Return the total number of pages and the current page number in the API response.
# Add error handling and logging:
1. Implement error handling for all API endpoints to catch and log any exceptions.
2. Use a logging service such as Winston or Log4js to log important events such as authentication failures, API errors, and image uploads.
3. Store the log information in a separate database or file for future analysis.
# Develop a real-time chat application:
1. Use WebSockets and Socket.io to allow users to send and receive messages in real-time.
2. Implement a messaging interface for users to communicate with each other.
3. Store the chat history for each user in the database for retrieval later.
4. Implement proper security measures such as input validation and protection against malicious input to ensure a secure chat environment.
# Send email notifications:
1. Create an endpoint to send email notifications using a transactional email service such as SendGrid or Mailgun.
2. Implement the ability to send emails to multiple recipients and include attachments if necessary.
3. Add proper error handling to ensure email delivery success.
# Implement password reset functionality:
1. Create a password reset endpoint that allows users to request a password reset via email.
2. Send a password reset email to the user containing a unique reset link.
3. Implement a page for users to reset their password using the reset link.
4. Update the user’s password in the database after a successful password reset.
# Create a task scheduling system:
1. Develop a task scheduling system using a task queue such as Bull or Kue to perform background jobs.
2. Create tasks such as sending emails, generating reports, and processing images that can be added to the task queue.
3. Implement a worker process to perform the tasks in the queue and update the task status in the database.
4. Implement proper error handling for task failures and retry mechanisms for failed tasks.
