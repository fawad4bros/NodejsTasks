# 1. Develop a RESTful API to manage user information:
1. Use Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) user records.
2. Store user information such as name, email, and password securely in the database.
3. Implement proper input validation for all API requests to ensure data integrity.

# 2. Implement authentication and authorization:
1. Use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to secure the API endpoints.
2. Create an endpoint for users to sign up and login, and return a JWT upon successful authentication.
3. Add middleware to verify the JWT on all protected endpoints.
4. Implement proper error handling for authentication failures.

# 3. Develop an endpoint to upload and store images:
1. Create an endpoint to receive image files and store them in a cloud storage service such as Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage.
2. Return a URL for the image that can be used to retrieve the image at a later time.
3. Implement proper error handling for image upload failures.

# 5. Implement pagination:
1. Add a pagination endpoint for the user data to return a specific number of records per page.
2. Allow users to specify the page number and number of records per page in the API request.
3. Return the total number of pages and the current page number in the API response.

# 6. Add error handling and logging:
1. Implement error handling for all API endpoints to catch and log any exceptions.
2. Use a logging service such as Winston or Log4js to log important events such as authentication failures, API errors, and image uploads.
3. Store the log information in a separate database or file for future analysis.
